🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository
Install dependencies (requirements.txt)
Run main.py to start the desktop application

### 🔧 Installation Requirements
This project requires **FFmpeg** (for video processing) and **OpenCV** (for image and video handling). Please follow the steps below to install them.

#### 📥 Install FFmpeg (Windows)
First install Pyside6 in python using:

    pip install PySide6
    

1. Download FFmpeg from the official builds:
   👉 [FFmpeg Download Page](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)

2. Download the file: **ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip**.

3. Extract the ZIP to a folder, e.g. `C:\ffmpeg`.

4. Add FFmpeg to your **PATH**:

   * Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`.
   * Go to **Advanced > Environment Variables**.
   * Under **System variables**, select `Path` → **Edit** → **New**.
   * Add:

         C:\ffmpeg\bin
     
           * Save and close.

5. Verify installation in Cmd:

       ffmpeg -version

   If you see version info, FFmpeg is installed successfully ✅


#### 📥 Install OpenCV (Python)

Run the following in your terminal (cmd, PowerShell, or VS Code terminal):
  
    pip install opencv-python


#### ✅ Quick Test

Check that both dependencies are working:

```bash
# Test OpenCV
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)

# Test FFmpeg
# Run in command prompt:
ffmpeg -version
```

If both return version info, your setup is complete 🚀



🧠 About Real-ESRGAN
This project uses the public **Real-ESRGAN** trained model as backend for image and video-Frames upscaling and denoising.  
You can find the model repository here: [Real-ESRGAN GitHub](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)


Real-ESRGAN (Real-Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) is an AI model designed for real-world image enhancement, capable of removing noise, restoring details, and producing natural high-resolution outputs.
Bring your images and videos back to life no need to prompt or genreate frames and extract then manuallu upscale and build etc, do this in just single button easliy and quickly with our InVisionX Denoiser user friendly Interface Tool.
